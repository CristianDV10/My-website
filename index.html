        <div class="boxl4">ABOUT US</div>
        <div class="boxm4">Every day, we go to work hoping to do two things: share great coffee with our friends and help make the world a little better.
            It was true when the first Neon opened in 1971, and it’s just as true today.
            Back then, the company was a single store in Seattle’s historic Pike Place Market. From just a narrow shop front, Neon coffeeShop offered some of the world’s finest fresh-roasted whole bean coffees. The name evoked the romance of Neon lights and the seafaring tradition of the early coffee traders.
            Today, with more than 32,000 stores in 80 countries, Neon is the premier roaster and retailer of specialty coffee in the world. And with every cup, we strive to bring both our heritage and an exceptional experience to life.</div>

        <div class="boxm5">Our sustainability programme, Coffee with Commitment, is our action plan to drive positive change in the areas where we can have the greatest impact, and that matter most to our teams, suppliers, partners and our consumers. It considers everything that's poured into your cup of perfectly crafted coffee – the ingredients you can see, as well as the ones you can't.</div>
